# nfl-ats-probability

Our goal for Project 4 is to create a model that will predict whether or not an NFL team will cover a point spread in a given game, and then predict the specific probability of said team covering. We will do this by first collecting data from various sources that house NFL data, cleaning the data into the necessary columns & values in Pandas then using Scikit-learn to train our data. Finally, we will present our results in a slide deck to show our data, thought processes, results and conclusions. Our visuals will be made using Matplotlib, RStudio and Tableau.
